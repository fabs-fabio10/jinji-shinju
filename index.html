    <h2 class="left">What is this?</h2>
    <p class="left"><b>Is for you!</b> I'm not really a creative person, despite me really wanting to be. 
        I can't give you anything despite really wanting be as such. I can't give you 
        anything physical for now, so here is a website! Sorry if this is kinda jank. Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy this website!</p>
    <p class="right" style="font-size: x-small">P.S. Do remember I want to be a data  scientist, not a web developer hehe..</p>

    <p class="left">A lot has happened these past few months. It has been over seven months now since I first messaged you. Hot damn, seven months. September 7, 2020 afternoon.
        I remember that we opened up to each other quite early in our chats too.  We've both said this before, we weren't looking for anything but we did find each other. I always say it but
        my time with you has been absolutely amazing. Yes, we might have our fights and arguments, but for me, that just means we care for each other, what the other does still matters and it still affects us.
        I don't say it as much as before but, I love you expontentially. I really do. Until now, I can say the same, it is still has an exponential growth. 

        <br><br>I'm sorry if I have changed from the person you met a few months ago. I'm sorry for all of my overthinking. I'm sorry for all the words that I have said that have made you feel invalidated. Until now, I still regret saying those things.
        I am sorry if I fixate on certain things, things that I want to see but are just under my nose. Until now the words you tell me when we come to an argument still haunts me, especially the first few ones. I know that you deserve the best, and 
        I'm not sure if I am the best, but I will do all I can to be the best. <span style="font-size:x-small">like no one ever was.</span> I know I always say communication yet I am the one who doesn't communicate. I am sorry for being a hypocrite.
        I am sorry if I am not specific, if I beat around the bush despite claiming to be a blunt person. 

        <br><br>You know, that's one thing I absolutely love about you. I can be transparent and blunt. But there have been times wherein I forget that, the times I don't get straight to the point on the things I want. I was scared. Scared of what you would think
        if I told you what I wanted to from you, what I wanted you to do. You're my best friend, my girlfriend, my significant other, yet I can't tell you what I want? Damn, what happened to me. I don't blame you. It's really me on that. Like I said, I forgot.
        I can be blunt with you. I can communicate with you. I can connect with you. I really apologize for that. Though this website-letter has too much apologizing, but I don't think it will stop. For now, amma focus on other things.

        <br><br>Like how just so amazing you really are. Like, legit. I know I have said this a lot but it is the truth. I am still lovestruck for you and I don't think it will ever disappear. I may not have a lot of experiences with relationships, but I really think you are the <b>one.</b>
        Thank you. Thank you for being born. Thank you for being here for me, from the start. Thank you for being someone I can lean on. Thank you for listening to my rants and vents. Thank you cheering me up when I needed it.
        Thank you for keeping me grounded. Thank you for being my moral compass. Thank you for being my Minecraft simp. Thank you for being my anime-watching buddy. Thank you for being my cuddle buddy.
        Thank you for being a kinky person with me. Thank you for being a friend to me. Thank you for being my best friend. Thank you for being someone I can love. Thank you for loving me.

        <br><br><i>*phew*</i> That was a lot of thank you's, I could still continue but I rather not make this entire website full of thank you's because I have more and more to write. Okay, this portion of the website is kinda gonna be just me and my thoughts really, so I'm sorry about it.
        During the early times of our relationship, I still remember the things I did and had to do back when I was at my aunts' place. I remember the day when I first sent you something, your birthday. I wrote that letter while I was in a call with you. I said I was doing acads during the time.
        Auntie Ye went out of her room while I was writing it. Then the day I would send it to you came, my aunts and I were heading to my cousins' place at PQ. I had to clutch Grab it, had to rush down before my family did. 
        
        <br><br>Fun Fact: Did you know that the first time you sent me NSFW pictures, in Messenger too, was the night before I asked you to be my girlfriend? Yes. Shush, I know it's an odd fact but yeah. We were talking about CNC for the first time. 
        You learned that it has a name to it and we talked more about it after. I love you expontentially. I am here for a long time, not just for a good time. I am here for you during your odd times, bad times, down times, good times, everything.
        I won't and don't want to leave you. I am here for you. Like I said in that message when I asked you, <q>Under no circumstance will I ever leave you.</q> Sorry if I'm annoying that I don't leave you alone when you fuck me off.
        I guess you can say, better safe than sorry really. I just don't want my old mistake of leaving you before to happen. <q>No matter what happens, I promise to work things out if something does happen.</q> A lot has happened, both good and bad. I think we have had our fair share of heated arguments, and we are able to work things out time and time again.
        <q>Do remember that I will always love you, back then, now, and it will continue to grow expontentially.</q> You told me before that it comes out that I don't take you seriously because I just say I love you out of nowhere when we argue. But to go back to that quote, 
        I will always love you, be it during arguments or lovey-dovey moments. I will always will love you. Heck. Math logic. Exponential growth cannot happen if it stops at one point, right? hEh.
