<marquee> I love you expontentially, my best beautiful baby, my waifu for laifu, my little munchkin, from princess to queen. </marquee>
    
    <h2 class="left">What is this?</h2>
    <p class="left"><b>Is for you!</b> I'm not really a creative person, despite me really wanting to be. 
        I can't give you anything despite really wanting be as such. I can't give you 
        anything physical for now, so here is a website! Sorry if this is kinda jank. Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy this website!</p>
    <p class="right" style="font-size: x-small">P.S. Do remember I want to be a data  scientist, not a web developer hehe..</p>

    <p class="left">A lot has happened these past few months. It has been over seven months now since I first messaged you. Hot damn, seven months. September 7, 2020 afternoon.
        I remember that we opened up to each other quite early in our chats too.  We've both said this before, we weren't looking for anything but we did find each other. I always say it but
        my time with you has been absolutely amazing. Yes, we might have our fights and arguments, but for me, that just means we care for each other, what the other does still matters and it still affects us.
        I don't say it as much as before but, I love you expontentially. I really do. Until now, I can say the same, it is still has an exponential growth. 

        <br><br>I'm sorry if I have changed from the person you met a few months ago. I'm sorry for all of my overthinking. I'm sorry for all the words that I have said that have made you feel invalidated. Until now, I still regret saying those things.
        I am sorry if I fixate on certain things, things that I want to see but are just under my nose. Until now the words you tell me when we come to an argument still haunts me, especially the first few ones. I know that you deserve the best, and 
        I'm not sure if I am the best, but I will do all I can to be the best. <span style="font-size:x-small">like no one ever was.</span> I know I always say communication yet I am the one who doesn't communicate. I am sorry for being a hypocrite.
        I am sorry if I am not specific, if I beat around the bush despite claiming to be a blunt person. 

        <br><br>You know, that's one thing I absolutely love about you. I can be transparent and blunt. But there have been times wherein I forget that, the times I don't get straight to the point on the things I want. I was scared. Scared of what you would think
        if I told you what I wanted to from you, what I wanted you to do. You're my best friend, my girlfriend, my significant other, yet I can't tell you what I want? Damn, what happened to me. I don't blame you. It's really me on that. Like I said, I forgot.
        I can be blunt with you. I can communicate with you. I can connect with you. I really apologize for that. Though this website-letter has too much apologizing, but I don't think it will stop. For now, amma focus on other things.

        <br><br>Like how just so amazing you really are. Like, legit. I know I have said this a lot but it is the truth. I am still lovestruck for you and I don't think it will ever disappear. I may not have a lot of experiences with relationships, but I really think you are the <b>one.</b>
        Thank you. Thank you for being born. Thank you for being here for me, from the start. Thank you for being someone I can lean on. Thank you for listening to my rants and vents. Thank you cheering me up when I needed it.
        Thank you for keeping me grounded. Thank you for being my moral compass. Thank you for being my Minecraft simp. Thank you for being my anime-watching buddy. Thank you for being my cuddle buddy.
        Thank you for being a kinky person with me. Thank you for being a friend to me. Thank you for being my best friend. Thank you for being someone I can love. Thank you for loving me.

        <br><br><i>*phew*</i> That was a lot of thank you's, I could still continue but I rather not make this entire website full of thank you's because I have more and more to write. Okay, this portion of the website is kinda gonna be just me and my thoughts really, so I'm sorry about it.
        During the early times of our relationship, I still remember the things I did and had to do back when I was at my aunts' place. I remember the day when I first sent you something, your birthday. I wrote that letter while I was in a call with you. I said I was doing acads during the time.
        Auntie Ye went out of her room while I was writing it. Then the day I would send it to you came, my aunts and I were heading to my cousins' place at PQ. I had to clutch Grab it, had to rush down before my family did. 
        
        <br><br>Fun Fact: Did you know that the first time you sent me NSFW pictures, in Messenger too, was the night before I asked you to be my girlfriend? Yes. Shush, I know it's an odd fact but yeah. We were talking about CNC for the first time. 
        You learned that it has a name to it and we talked more about it after. I love you expontentially. I am here for a long time, not just for a good time. I am here for you during your odd times, bad times, down times, good times, everything.
        I won't and don't want to leave you. I am here for you. Like I said in that message when I asked you, <q>Under no circumstance will I ever leave you.</q> Sorry if I'm annoying that I don't leave you alone when you fuck me off.
        I guess you can say, better safe than sorry really. I just don't want my old mistake of leaving you before to happen. <q>No matter what happens, I promise to work things out if something does happen.</q> A lot has happened, both good and bad. I think we have had our fair share of heated arguments, and we are able to work things out time and time again.
        <q>Do remember that I will always love you, back then, now, and it will continue to grow expontentially.</q> You told me before that it comes out that I don't take you seriously because I just say I love you out of nowhere when we argue. But to go back to that quote, 
        I will always love you, be it during arguments or lovey-dovey moments. I will always will love you. Heck. Math logic. Exponential growth cannot happen if it stops at one point, right? hEh.

        <br><br>Do you remember the time wherein we were planning on how to play Among Us if we were Imposters together? Like we said that we'd go for Karl or Raj first since they're the smarties in the group. Then we'd go for Nando or Iko since they're really intuitive. I think we should plan soon again.
        We have been playing a lot of Among Us recently. I wish we can be Imposters together again soon. I'm sorry if I have been killing and marinating you a lot, but I do resist a lot as well because I want you enjoy too. Damn. I'm still being a simp even during <q>competitive</q> play. Speaking of games,
        Thank you for introducing me to amazing games or at least giving me motivation to start playing them from my <q>to play list.</q> Like Cuphead, Kingdom Hearts, Detroit, Catherine, and I'm sure many more to come! Though I hope when you play my games, you'll feel the same way as I am with yours. No pressure though hehe.
        Forewarning a bit, there might be some learning curve but don't worry, I'll be there to help you get on your feet. The others like Josh and Iko will be there too to assist and help. We'll have a great time I bet. Also, speaking of Josh and Iko, they're still waiting to teach you how to play League. Don't be afraid to bring it up to them again, alright?
        There's a lot to talk about gaming to just write it in one paragraph so I'll leave some more for future Carlos to write about in the following paragraphs. 

        <br><br>I remember back then wherein your mum would call me the <q>data science guy</q> and that she got a hint that you liked a guy because you started to play the gee-tar again. Your family is just amazing, I don't know, maybe I just have a shit family but yours is absolutely amazing to me. Yes, this paragraph will be a bit about your family, yeah. The first day we saw each other, was the day I also I met your family.
        Your mum called me awkward, I wonder what she thinks of me now. That time when I was thinking of where or what to shift to, you were hyped for me too. You are really supportive of me, thank you. I'm more of intimidated by your mum than your dad actually. For me, it seems like your mum could do more damage than your dad in general. Though Bila on the other hand, 
        I am surprised with the epic nerd comment. That's a compliment? And she actually thinks good-ish of me. Bren and your dad? Well I don't know much of their thoughts really, kinda like an enigma. But really though, from the physical needs like food and luxuries to emotional or non-physical needs, it seems like you guys are covered. Like, yeah, there are ups and downs to it but every family has anyway. I've said it before and I'll say it again,
        I don't want to do anything too risky or anything against your family that will compromise our relationship. I love you and your family.     

        <br><br>You know I also remember the day before our first monthsarry, November, you told me about your talk about yourself. The one if you were sure about this relationship, because it was just our first month and a lot of shit has happened already. I asked that what you want to do and you said that there is nothing you can do about it and that you committed so you had no choice.
        That made me kind of overthink a bit because it made me think that you only stayed because of the commitment not because you actually enjoyed being in the realtionship. Don't worry that is long gone. This was also the evening wherein you called with your friends, Mikiyo and Berns were there if I remember correctly, and you showed them the BDSM body knot in video call. When midnight hit of our first monthsarry, you were still in that call. 
        We talked and called during that night. I remember that I really wanted to say happy first monthsarry but not because, yeah. That's the reason why this is in the making. That first month was rough, first few months really, no denying that but it was a bewilderment to me. I was really still in shock as to how you were interested in me and how you were my girlfriend too. Telegram Enderpearl that lead to cuddles and wholesomeness but the next time it 
        would be used, it was for NSFW BDSM pictures. Nice. I'm still curious as to how you would look like if you did edit them into cat girl ones. But the best thing I received during this time was that video you made for me. It was really swag, specially your shades. Expect one from me soon? Maybe. Don't know. Let us not forget your birthday too! I was at my cousin's place in PQ during the time. We called while he was in the room, he's okay. I was happy
        I could celebrate your birthday even just a bit. This year, I'll be there, for sure. 

        <br><br>Later November to December, well, four words: Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. This was time wherein I was watching FMA:B. This was also the time I was having troubles with Dean Glenn quite a bit, or at least the start of it. FMA:B is the first recommendation you gave me. And I really loved it. It's still quite memorable to me actually, I kinda wanna watch the movie just for laughs actually. 
        I think this was also the time wherein I helped you with your old paper, until the copyright issue happened. But in the end, things worked out in the end. This was also solitaire season too! Damn. I wanna play more card and board games with your sisters. I know this thing is still next month but yeah. Cuphead. The month you received Cuphead from me. The month that you got angry a lot because of a game. 
        Let's play and finish it together soon, okay? But yeah, there were some stuff that were not great. But that just really motivated me to move out. Yes. I'll admit, you are the  main reason why I want to move out. I know I've said that you are one of the main reasons but you are the MAIN reason really for me to push myself to move out. Because I don't want my circumstances to get between us. 

        <br><br>Second month! This is the month that we first greeted ourselves for a monthsarry, you iniated this because I wasn't sure if I should. This was the month that you sent me a letter-like message too. I kept back reading it back then, and sometimes now too. What really touched me in that message is that you said that you're thankful that you can really be yourself with me and that I'm patient when it comes to personal problems. That you can lean on me. 
        The fact that you met a lot of great people. And last but defintetly not the least, the banat: <q>For opening up a lot of things for me, my heart, my friend circle, and prolly my legs in the future.</q> You don't like people watching you fap yet here we are, fapping quite frequently. Remember that time I first showed you my dicc? My aunts were out but they soon came home after that. You would also fap sometimes while I just watch and my aunts would walk by from time to time.
        December was the month wherein I was thinking of hosting an archery meet up with you and ED Bros. It was going to be fun and will fill up my craving to do archery but nope, didn't happen. I did get something better though. A condo unit, hEh.  But before that, according to my NSFW album, this was also the time that you did that lingerie pictorial, pretty hot until now, makes me want to dominate you even more really. Wait. Wasn't this also the month that you and your sisters got some 
        weeb stuff? Like the Akatsuki robe and jearseys? That Akatsuki robe is memoreable, but I wonder why. Maybe because it also happened during an end of an era and the start of a new one, the Purple Hair Era started.

        <br><br> Our first meet up and, of course, our first date. We invited Josh, Iko, Nando, and Raj to meet up but one by one they said no. And by the end we hoped that everyone would really say no so that we can have time for ourselves.  We planned already to meet up in Megamall or Galleria but then last minute your parents say no because of traffic. We almost did not push through, but of course, am not gonna have that. So you said that they were okay with Glo, I was all means willing to go.
        Compromise. Your parents are okay, as long it's there, then g. You thought I was mad at you and even asked me why I was cold. You got upset because you didn't know what to do. But I suggested to go to Glo since that is what your parents said yes to, but you were worried that I'll be the one who will have to go through traffic. Your parents even offered me to come over for New Year if I remember correctly too. We talked about how cute it would be to do a New Year kiss, which spoilers, we did do.
        Christmas shopping. The day. I went Christmas gift shopping first in Podium and Megamall before going to Galleria for BIR. Speaking of Podium, we should really have a date there, not much activities to do but the restaurants are nice. Plus we can go to Megamall across it for activies, yeah. Anyway, after Galleria I went straight to Glorietta. You were surprised that I finished quick. You were wearing black and white during that day. The denim jacket with white tube and black skirt. It was cute and hot, 
        a deadly combination really. On the way to Glorietta, I think you had Charlie with you. She was there and Chocnut too. Around 12:50 PM, I saw you. But you didn't know where I was first. We met up at the Lacoste area. The first thing you did when we saw each otehr was hug me. I hugged you back too. It was a very natural response for me to do so. I wasn't uncomfortable. It felt right to have you wrapped around my arms. I actually wanted to hug you a little longer, okay not just little, but you know COVID and public.
        After the hugging, we did the forbidden act, hand holding. Oh, noes. But even that, first time holding hands with someone and it felt normal, not awkward or anything of the sort. We held hands as you lead us to Ramen Nagi-- wait, no. We got lost while trying to head to Ramen Nagi. We ate. Simping happened. Gift shopping happened. BLK happened. I forgot who said I love you first, oh yeah, it was you! I love you exponentially too. But you know, I really enjoyed going through shop to shop with you. I wish we could 
        have gotten a Timezone picture or something but I guess that will have to wait after quarantine. We looked at figurines and boardgames as well. But this gave me an idea for the future, the Funko Pop ones. Then our time in Glo ended, it was time to team your family. Wops. You know how it went so I'll focus on a certain slap. A slap from a purple-haired Akatsuki. Before you slapped me, I really wanted to have our first kiss, I was anxious and trying to think on how to go abouts it but that slap was the perfect way 
        to do it. It was nice and cute. After that, we made out then, a bit after, I laid on your lap. It was a really wholesome night. I hope we can make out more, it feels nice. I know am not good at it but I also know I can get better, so yeah. 

        <br><br> I'm sure you're expective the next four months of text to be here but this is less than two months of content yet I have already written this much. I'm sorry to cut it short but you really want to read it already, and I'll read it to you this coming Sunday, if your mum says yes that is. I love you exponentially, nothing has hindered that, and I think nothing will ever hinder that. I am here for you. I am here for a long time. See you soon, my best beautiful baby. My munchkin queen. My little pearl.
