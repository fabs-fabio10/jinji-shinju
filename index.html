    <h2 class="left">What is this?</h2>
    <p class="left"><b>Is for you!</b> I'm not really a creative person, despite me really wanting to be. 
        I can't give you anything despite really wanting be as such. I can't give you 
        anything physical for now, so here is a website! Sorry if this is kinda jank. Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy this website!</p>
    <p class="right" style="font-size: x-small">P.S. Do remember I want to be a data  scientist, not a web developer hehe..</p>

    <p class="left">A lot has happened these past few months. It has been over seven months now since I first messaged you. Hot damn, seven months. September 7, 2020 afternoon.
        I remember that we opened up to each other quite early in our chats too.  We've both said this before, we weren't looking for anything but we did find each other. I always say it but
        my time with you has been absolutely amazing. Yes, we might have our fights and arguments, but for me, that just means we care for each other, what the other does still matters and it still affects us.
        I don't say it as much as before but, I love you expontentially. I really do. Until now, I can say the same, it is still has an exponential growth. 

        <br><br>I'm sorry if I have changed from the person you met a few months ago. I'm sorry for all of my overthinking. I'm sorry for all the words that I have said that have made you feel invalidated. Until now, I still regret saying those things.
        I am sorry if I fixate on certain things, things that I want to see but are just under my nose. Until now the words you tell me when we come to an argument still haunts me, especially the first few ones. I know that you deserve the best, and 
        I'm not sure if I am the best, but I will do all I can to be the best. <span style="font-size:x-small">like no one ever was.</span> I know I always say communication yet I am the one who doesn't communicate. I am sorry for being a hypocrite.
        I am sorry if I am not specific, if I beat around the bush despite claiming to be a blunt person. 

        You know, that's one thing I absolutely love about you. I can be transparent and blunt. But there have been times wherein I forget that, the times I don't get straight to the point on the things I want. I was scared. Scared of what you would think
        if I told you what I wanted to from you, what I wanted you to do. You're my best friend, my girlfriend, my significant other, yet I can't tell you what I want? Damn, what happened to me. I don't blame you. It's really me on that. Like I said, I forgot.
        I can be blunt with you. I can communicate with you. I can connect with you.
